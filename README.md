# Welcome to DDD and EF Core

This is the source code for my Pluralsight course [DDD and EF Core][l1]

## How to Get Started

Create a database using the Database-initial.sql script, modify the connection string in appsettings.json, and you are good to go!

## Source code for each module

Source code for each module is tagged and available on the [Releases tab][l2]. For example, tag "module-3-working-with-many-to-one-relationships" indicates the state of the sample project at the start of module 3, which is named "Working with Many-to-one Relationships"
